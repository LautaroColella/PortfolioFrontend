============== Production
- Be careful with '*' as Access-Control-Allow-Origin in production. Change this back only to the clients that are allowed to connect to the API (frontend)

Add to the readme: what's next, features, contact by webiste, website link at the description
remove test andd translations section

favicon

=============== development

Sanitize all input in the the frontend, currently is only validated in the backend, and the backend doesn't require any type of sanitization
When the ID is autogenerated don't add the id field to the object
also do CSP in the frontend:
https://angular.io/guide/security#trusted-types
https://angular.io/guide/security#content-security-policy

Unit testing in everything and end-to-end testing

Add a layer so it only makes one api call instead of every time the route changes


===== less important
Add real data, delete all examples

Responsive

Fancy loading page

Transitions/effects to almost everything, same for fonts and colors
Also, something in the UI to show the request status: https://angular.io/guide/http#tracking-and-showing-request-progress

Add support to non javascript users

Make all the html, scss and ts code the best I can





Contact page:
- Allow 3 messages/hour per ip
- Send notification to email
// done {
	- Add right bar to the socials, same as in about journey, so there's no social's limit
	- Get the contact data from the backend
	- Show item id somewhere
	- Change trash color while hovering in profiles that don't have link
	- Save the message in the database
}

======================= done

	- Onclick on element display the view in cascade
	- Floating button to go to top and one for each view, onclick on top close all views
	- When closing all the tabs for pressing in the arrow to go to the top the tab's arrows don't change
	- Home view
	- Use the cookie of the client as auth header to send the admin requests to the backend
	- Work view
	* Search bar to enter the work item id/name in case the method is put/delete
	* Select element to select the http method, onchange load the required fields
	- About view

}
//done {
	Login page
}
// done {
	Home page:
	- Receive all the data from the backend
	- Make the titles work
}
// done {
	About page:
	- Add description to items
	- Show date of item on hover
	- Only show the side arrows if there is more than 1 page
	- Change about page icon for something else
	- Onclick on item makes a get request to the item id and shows the user stuff about the item (description, date, how I got it, where I used it, etc) replacing "My journey" text (maybe also replacing the buttons)
	- Read the html tags in the description and make them work
	- The knowledge button should be black in the constructor
	- "get this from the database" my journey
	- showItemInfo() should be done better and fancy
	- Go to other items if mentioned in the description of the item. MAKE THIS WITH THE FUNCTION showItemInfo(item_id)
	- Bug: When there's only one item in the new page it is not shown
}
// done {
	Login page:
	- Only the correct username and password should be redirected to the admin page and get the JWT set
}
// done {
	Work page:
	- Get the work data from the backend
	- Only show the side arrows if there are more projects than the screen capacity
	- Add page selector at the side of the order by, it must have overflow x visible and numbers below, don't show more than 5
	- Make the order by options work
	- Bug: When there's only one item in the new page it is not shown, probably the same happens for the about page
	- Bug: when selecting different order by there are more pages added, yet you can't select them, is something visual
	- Show the project technologies instead of the description when hovering on the project
	- Add button to see more of the project at the side of the view live button, and when clicked show the description, replacing all the projects in the screen (maybe even adapting to the project position)
	- Add id after project name when viewing the description
}
