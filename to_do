Transitions/effects to almost everything



Admin page:
- Everything


Home page:
- Do a get request to the information table to receive all the titles
- Make the titles work


Work page:
- Add button to see more of the project at the side of the view live button, and when clicked make a get request for the project id and show more info about it, replacing all the projects in the screen (maybe even adapting to the project position). SAME AS IN THE ABOUT PAGE
- Make the order by options work
- Bug: When there's only one item in the new page it is not shown, probably the same happens for the about page
// done
- Get the work data from the backend
- Only show the side arrows if there are more projects than the screen capacity
- Add page selector at the side of the order by, it must have overflow x visible and numbers below, don't show more than 5


Contact page:
- Get the contact data from the backend
- Send email with the form
- Allow 1 email/hour per ip
- Add right bar to the socials, same as in about journey, so there's no social's limit
// done






// done
Login page:
- Only the correct username and password should be redirected to the admin page and get the JWT set


// done
About page:
- Add description to items
- Show date of item on hover
- Only show the side arrows if there is more than 1 page
- Change about page icon for something else
- Onclick on item makes a get request to the item id and shows the user stuff about the item (description, date, how I got it, where I used it, etc) replacing "My journey" text (maybe also replacing the buttons)
- Read the html tags in the description and make them work
- The knowledge button should be black in the constructor
- "get this from the database" my journey
- showItemInfo() should be done better and fancy
- Go to other items if mentioned in the description of the item. MAKE THIS WITH THE FUNCTION showItemInfo(item_id)
