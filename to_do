Redirecto to error pages 401, 404, 500

Error handling in everything
//HttpErrorResponse

Sanitize all input, even admin and server input, both in the frontend and in the backend

Unit testing in everything

Readme

Responsive

Add real data

Fancy loading page

Transitions/effects to almost everything

Add a layer so it only makes one api call instead of every time the route changes

Make all the html, scss and ts code the best I can

Add the typescript type to all the values and functions, remove all "any" and add "void" to functions

Replace all repeated ids with classes:
"You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document."





Admin page:
- Views
- Use the cookie of the client as auth header to send the admin requests to the backend
// done
- Main structure
- Logout button
- Create a backend uri to send a request that only authorized users can do, and use the cookie as the authorization header. If error logout
- Onclick on element display the view in cascade
- Floating button to go to top and one for each view, onclick on top close all views
- When closing all the tabs for pressing in the arrow to go to the top the tab's arrows don't change






Contact page:
- Send message to the admin page with the form
- Allow 3 messages/hour per ip
// done
- Add right bar to the socials, same as in about journey, so there's no social's limit
- Get the contact data from the backend




//done
Login page:
- Something to fill the space


// done
Home page:
- Receive all the data from the backend
- Make the titles work


// done
About page:
- Add description to items
- Show date of item on hover
- Only show the side arrows if there is more than 1 page
- Change about page icon for something else
- Onclick on item makes a get request to the item id and shows the user stuff about the item (description, date, how I got it, where I used it, etc) replacing "My journey" text (maybe also replacing the buttons)
- Read the html tags in the description and make them work
- The knowledge button should be black in the constructor
- "get this from the database" my journey
- showItemInfo() should be done better and fancy
- Go to other items if mentioned in the description of the item. MAKE THIS WITH THE FUNCTION showItemInfo(item_id)
- Bug: When there's only one item in the new page it is not shown


// done
Login page:
- Only the correct username and password should be redirected to the admin page and get the JWT set


Work page:
- Add "currently working" button, show commit history of the projects, etc
// done
- Get the work data from the backend
- Only show the side arrows if there are more projects than the screen capacity
- Add page selector at the side of the order by, it must have overflow x visible and numbers below, don't show more than 5
- Make the order by options work
- Bug: When there's only one item in the new page it is not shown, probably the same happens for the about page
- Bug: when selecting different order by there are more pages added, yet you can't select them, is something visual
- Show the project technologies instead of the description when hovering on the project
- Add button to see more of the project at the side of the view live button, and when clicked show the description, replacing all the projects in the screen (maybe even adapting to the project position)
